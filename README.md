 TASK 2
 Number Guessing Game using Python

This project is part of my internship at Alfido Tech. The task was to develop an interactive Number Guessing Game in Python where the user guesses a randomly generated number with helpful feedback for each attempt.

✨ Features

🎲 Random number generation within a specified range

🔁 Loops to allow multiple guessing attempts

📈 Hints provided (higher/lower) based on the guess

✅ Input validation for handling invalid entries

🧠 Key Learnings

🔄 Implementing loop structures for repeated execution

🎲 Using Python’s random module for number generation

🧐 Applying conditional logic for decision-making

✔ Validating user input effectively

🎯 Purpose

This project helped enhance my logical thinking and problem-solving skills, while reinforcing Python fundamentals for interactive command-line programs.
